Physical address is an address (location) in one memory component. Virtual address is an address that is mapped to physical one of some memory component.
Physical addresses are limited in size (of memory unit), but virtual ones are not.
Physical addresses always exist and are the same, but virtual ones are dynamically mapped by operating systems.
