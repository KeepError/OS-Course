Result depends on number of bits that are allocated for the counter and maximum number of pages in memory.
Page will be flushed in {maximum number of pages} or {counter bits + 1} after reference if it will not be referenced again
So let's suppose we allocated 32 bits for counter and have 5 maximum number of pages

So to maximize hit/miss ratio we may have references:
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 ... and so on

To minimize:
1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 ...
We reference pages immediately after their flushing
